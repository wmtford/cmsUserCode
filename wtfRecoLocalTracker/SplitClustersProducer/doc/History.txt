Use new interface to TrackerHitAssociator::associateSimpleRecHitCluster,
which avoids calling it twice.
(needs SimTracker/TrackerHitAssociation V01-04-07)

27 Oct 2009  wtford -- V01-01-04
SplitClustersProducer:  Change call to
TrackerHitAssociator::associateSimpleRecHitCluster to match modified
interface in V01-04-06 of SimTracker/TrackerHitAssociation.

24 Oct 2009  wtford -- V01-01-03
SplitClustersProducer:  Remove loops on RecHits, since we now have
access to hit association directly from the cluster.  (Needs
SimTracker/TrackerHitAssociation V01-04-05.)
SplitClustersProducer, SplitClustersAlgos:  Add option to split clusters
associated with 2 SimTrackracks, as alternative to splitting when there
are 2 associated SimHits.  In the config one can now set
process.siStripSplitClusters = cms.EDProducer("SplitClustersProducer",
                                              splitBy = cms.string('byHits'))
or                                                                 'byTracks'

11 Oct 2009  wtford -- V01-01-02
SplitClustersProducer:  add method SplitClustersProducer::dumpSimTracks
to inspect the original and split clusters.  This requires also the tags
V06-01-08      DataFormats/TrackerRecHit2D                      
V01-04-04      SimTracker/TrackerHitAssociation                 
with a private modification to TrackerHitAssociator: new function
overload 
std::vector<PSimHit> associateSimpleRecHitCluster(const SiStripCluster*);

4 Oct 2009  wtford -- V01-01-01
Add new base class SplitClustersAlgos to provide leftStripCount() either
to this package or to ClusterAnalyzer.
SplitClustersProducer:  Add inheritance from SplitClustersAlgos and
remove leftStripCount() to SplitClustersAlgos.
Add plugins/SealModule.cc and plugins/Buildfile to create the library
needed by the Analyzer.

The producer job was leaking about 3MB per event.  This is true even if
the SplitClustersProducer::produce() method returns at the top.
The job crashes at event 649.
25 Sept., 2009
The leaky module is the trackInfo.  I learn from e-mail from Chiara
Genta that in fact trackInfo is obsolete and unsupported.  It suffices
just to eliminate the trackInfo module from the path.

Fixed a small bug in split cluster producer:  2nd cluster's left edge
was being placed at the center of the original cluster, rather than
adjacent to the new first cluster.

Add member function SplitClustersProducer::leftStripCount, since this
code is repeated twice in the producer.  Separate the producer
declaration into a header file (the idea was to make leftStripCount
accessible to the analyzer as well, but I've not succeeded with this so
far).

7 Aug 2009  wtford -- Migration from (Marco Cardaci's) CMSSW_2_1_9 to
CMSSW_3_1_2.
1.  Some complaints about the build file.  I just commented out the
offending lines.
2.  After much struggle, found the access to hits collection had to be
modified (here and in the stereo collection loop): 
210c210,214
<    for(SiStripRecHit2DCollection::const_iterator rechitsrphiIter = rechitsrphi->begin(); rechitsrphiIter != rechitsrphi->end(); ++rechitsrphiIter) {
---
>    const SiStripRecHit2DCollection::DataContainer& rechitsrphiColl = rechitsrphi->data();
>    for(SiStripRecHit2DCollection::DataContainer::const_iterator rechitsrphiIter = rechitsrphiColl.begin(); rechitsrphiIter != rechitsrphiColl.end(); ++rechitsrphiIter) {
>     const SiStripRecHit2D *aHit = &*(rechitsrphiIter);
> //     DetId mydet1 = aHit->geographicalId();
> //     if (idet.rawId() != mydet1.rawId()) continue;
212c216
<     if(rechitsrphiIter->cluster().isNonnull()){clust=&(*rechitsrphiIter->cluster());}
---
>     if(aHit->cluster().isNonnull()) {clust=&(*rechitsrphiIter->cluster());}
This is based on an example in 
CMSSW/Alignment/CommonAlignmentProducer/src/AlignmentTrackSelector.cc
