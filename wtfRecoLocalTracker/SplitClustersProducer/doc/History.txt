21 Sept 2009  wtford --
The producer job is leaking about 3MB per event.  This is true even if
the SplitClustersProducer::produce() method returns at the top.
The job crashes at event 649.
25 Sept., 2009
The leaky module is the trackInfo.  I learn from e-mail from Chiara
Genta that in fact trackInfo is obsolete and unsupported.  It suffices
just to eliminate the trackInfo module from the path.

Fixed a small bug in split cluster producer:  2nd cluster's left edge
was being placed at the center of the original cluster, rather than
adjacent to the new first cluster.

Add member function SplitClustersProducer::leftStripCount, since this
code is repeated twice in the producer.  Separate the producer
declaration into a header file (the idea was to make leftStripCount
accessible to the analyzer as well, but I've not succeeded with this so
far).

7 Aug 2009  wtford -- Migration from (Marco Cardaci's) CMSSW_2_1_9 to
CMSSW_3_1_2.
1.  Some complaints about the build file.  I just commented out the
offending lines.
2.  After much struggle, found the access to hits collection had to be
modified (here and in the stereo collection loop): 
210c210,214
<    for(SiStripRecHit2DCollection::const_iterator rechitsrphiIter = rechitsrphi->begin(); rechitsrphiIter != rechitsrphi->end(); ++rechitsrphiIter) {
---
>    const SiStripRecHit2DCollection::DataContainer& rechitsrphiColl = rechitsrphi->data();
>    for(SiStripRecHit2DCollection::DataContainer::const_iterator rechitsrphiIter = rechitsrphiColl.begin(); rechitsrphiIter != rechitsrphiColl.end(); ++rechitsrphiIter) {
>     const SiStripRecHit2D *aHit = &*(rechitsrphiIter);
> //     DetId mydet1 = aHit->geographicalId();
> //     if (idet.rawId() != mydet1.rawId()) continue;

<     if(rechitsrphiIter->cluster().isNonnull()){clust=&(*rechitsrphiIter->cluster());}
---
>     if(aHit->cluster().isNonnull()) {clust=&(*rechitsrphiIter->cluster());}
This is based on an example in 
CMSSW/Alignment/CommonAlignmentProducer/src/AlignmentTrackSelector.cc
